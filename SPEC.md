# Scriptum - Complete Specification

> Local-first collaborative markdown with seamless git sync and first-class agent support.

---

# Part 1: Product

## Vision

Writing should feel like writing, not committing. Collaboration should be effortless. Your files are yours, locally.

Scriptum bridges the gap between GitHub (too heavy for collaboration) and Notion (too locked-in, hostile to local editing). It's a **hosted markdown collaboration tool** that lets you edit files locally with any editor, collaborate in real-time on the web, and automatically syncs to git with AI-generated commit messages.

## Core Principles

1. **Local-first**: Your data lives on your machine. Local replica is authoritative — solo and offline use work fully without a server. The relay is required only for multi-user collaboration and cross-device sync.
2. **Markdown-native**: Pure `.md` files on disk. No proprietary format. No lock-in.
3. **Conflict-free data, coordinated editing**: CRDT ensures no data loss at the data layer — every character from every editor is preserved. Intent system and section awareness ensure no surprises at the UX layer — concurrent edits to the same section are surfaced for review, not silently interleaved.
4. **Git-optional**: Push to GitHub/any git remote with AI-generated commits. Or don't. Git is a sync target, not a dependency.
5. **Agent-friendly**: AI agents are first-class collaborators with attribution, not second-class citizens bolted on.

## Target Users

### Primary
- **Developer teams**: Technical docs, RFCs, ADRs, READMEs, runbooks
- **Mixed teams**: Engineers + PMs + designers collaborating on specs, proposals, planning docs
- **AI-assisted workflows**: Claude Code, Cursor, custom agents editing docs alongside humans

### Secondary
- **Personal knowledge base**: Notes, journals, research - personal Obsidian alternative with collaboration
- **Open source projects**: Documentation that multiple contributors can edit simultaneously

## Features

### 1. Rich Markdown Editor

A hybrid live-preview editing experience powered by **CodeMirror 6** with a custom live preview extension (reference: `codemirror-markdown-hybrid`, MIT). The active line shows raw markdown for precise editing; unfocused lines render as rich text (similar to Obsidian's live preview). This preserves exact markdown formatting -- what you type is what gets stored.

- **Hybrid live preview**: Active line shows raw markdown, unfocused lines render inline as rich text (headings, bold, links, etc.)
- **Exact formatting preservation**: No normalization. Raw markdown is stored as-is in the CRDT and on disk.
- **Pure markdown storage**: Files on disk are always valid `.md` files -- the exact bytes you typed
- **GFM core + extensions**: Tables, task lists, footnotes, code blocks with syntax highlighting. Extensions beyond GFM: math (KaTeX), diagrams (Mermaid).
- **Slash commands**: `/table`, `/code`, `/image`, `/callout` for quick insertion
- **Drag and drop**: Images, files - auto-uploaded and linked

### 2. Real-Time Collaboration

Multiple people editing the same document simultaneously.

- **Live cursors**: See where collaborators are typing, with name labels
- **Presence indicators**: Who's online, who's viewing which document
- **Character-level CRDT**: Powered by Yjs - merges are conflict-free at the character level
- **Section awareness**: Overlay on top of CRDT that detects when two editors are in the same markdown section, showing a subtle indicator
- **Offline support**: Edit offline, changes merge seamlessly when you reconnect
- **Intent/lease system**: Editors can "claim" a section with a TTL (e.g., `scriptum_claim(section, ttl=10m, note="rewriting auth")`). UI shows a colored badge next to the section heading: `## Authentication [claude-1 editing]`. Other editors see a warning but can still edit — leases are advisory, non-blocking. Lifecycle: TTL-only (no explicit release RPC needed). Activity auto-extends TTL. Stored in daemon memory + local SQLite. Cross-device visibility via relay awareness protocol (lightweight, eventual consistency).
- **Reconciliation UI**: When >50% of a section's characters are changed by 2+ distinct editors within 30 seconds, trigger reconciliation. Both versions shown inline within the document, separated by a subtle divider. "Keep A / Keep B / Keep Both" buttons — resolution happens in the editor, no separate view. Prevents the worst CRDT interleaving UX.
- **Commenting**: Inline comments on selections, threaded discussions, resolve/unresolve. Comments are for discussion and conversation -- not an approval workflow. No tracked changes or suggesting mode.

### 3. Local Editing & Sync

Edit with any tool on your machine - VS Code, Vim, Claude Code, custom scripts.

- **Local file sync**: Documents exist as `.md` files in a local folder
- **File watcher**: Background daemon detects local file changes, diffs them, and feeds changes into the CRDT
- **Bidirectional sync**: Changes from remote collaborators are written back to local files
- **Any editor**: If it can edit a file, it works with Scriptum
- **Conflict-free**: Even rapid local edits from multiple tools merge cleanly via CRDT

### 4. Agent Integration (First-Class)

AI agents are treated as collaborators, not tools.

**CLI (`scriptum` command)** *(inspired by [Niwa](https://github.com/secemp9/niwa)'s agent-first CLI design)*:
```bash
# Core editing workflow
scriptum read doc.md --section "## Authentication" --agent claude-1
scriptum edit doc.md --section "## Authentication" --content "new content" --agent claude-1 --summary "Added OAuth2 PKCE flow"
scriptum edit doc.md --section "## Authentication" --file content.md --agent claude-1  # From file (for complex content)

# Agent state management (critical for sub-agents / context switches)
scriptum whoami                      # Suggest unique agent name, show workspace state
scriptum status --agent claude-1     # Pending edits, active sections, recent changes by this agent
scriptum conflicts --agent claude-1  # Section-level overlap warnings (other agents editing same sections)
scriptum agents                      # List all agents currently interacting with this workspace

# Workspace operations
scriptum ls                          # List workspace documents
scriptum tree doc.md                 # Show document section structure with IDs
scriptum diff doc.md                 # Show pending changes since last git commit
scriptum search "authentication"     # Full-text search across workspace

# Section targeting
scriptum sections doc.md             # List all sections with IDs, versions, last editor
scriptum peek doc.md --section "## Auth"  # Quick read without registering edit intent
```

**Key CLI design principles** (learned from Niwa):
- **Explicit `--agent` flag**: Every mutating operation requires an agent name for attribution
- **`--summary` on edits**: Agents describe their intent, which helps other agents understand concurrent changes
- **`read` before `edit`**: Reading a section registers intent, enabling smarter overlap detection
- **State survives context switches**: Agent state (pending reads, active sections) persists in the daemon, so sub-agents spawned with fresh context can run `scriptum status` to recover state
- **`--file` flag for complex content**: Avoids shell quoting issues with multi-line markdown
- **`--section` edit semantics**: `scriptum edit --section "## Auth" --content "..."` replaces everything between the heading and the next same-or-higher-level heading. The heading line itself is preserved.
- **Output format**: Auto-detected. TTY → human-readable text. Piped/redirected → structured JSON. Agents in non-TTY environments get JSON automatically.
- **Exit codes**: 0=success, 1=general error, 2=usage error, 10=daemon not running, 11=auth failed, 12=conflict/overlap warning, 13=network error

**MCP Server**:
- Native integration with Claude Code, Cursor, and any MCP-compatible agent
- Tools: `scriptum_read`, `scriptum_edit`, `scriptum_list`, `scriptum_tree`, `scriptum_status`, `scriptum_conflicts`, `scriptum_history`, `scriptum_subscribe`, `scriptum_agents`, `scriptum_claim`, `scriptum_bundle`
- `scriptum_claim(section_id, ttl, mode, note)`: Claim a section with advisory lease
- `scriptum_bundle(doc, section_id, include=[parents, children, backlinks, comments], token_budget=N)`: Get optimally-sized context for a section in one call. Token counting via tiktoken-rs (cl100k_base) for accurate budget management. Truncation priority: comments first, then backlinks, then children, then parents — section content is never truncated.
- Resources: `scriptum://docs/{id}`, `scriptum://docs/{id}/sections`, `scriptum://workspace`, `scriptum://agents`
- **Change notifications**: Polling-based. `scriptum_status` returns a `change_token`. Agent polls periodically; token changes when watched docs update. No push over stdio — simple, reliable, works with all MCP transports.
- Agent name derived from MCP client config (no manual `--agent` needed). Falls back to `mcp-agent` if client config has no name.

**Claude Code Hooks** *(directly inspired by Niwa)*:
```bash
scriptum setup claude      # Install hooks into .claude/settings.json
scriptum setup claude --remove
```

| Hook | Trigger | Action |
|------|---------|--------|
| **SessionStart** | Claude session begins | Injects workspace status + CLI quick reference into context |
| **PreCompact** | Before `/compact` | Preserves Scriptum context so Claude remembers docs state after compaction |
| **PreToolUse** | Before Write/Edit on `.md` files | Warns if other agents are editing the same section, suggests using `scriptum edit` instead |
| **PostToolUse** | After Write/Edit on `.md` files | Confirms file watcher picked up the change and synced to CRDT |
| **Stop** | Session ending | Reminds about any unsynced changes or section overlaps |

**File System Watching** (fallback):
- Agents that can't use CLI/MCP can just edit `.md` files directly
- File watcher picks up changes, diffs, and merges via CRDT
- Attribution inferred from process/user context when possible
- Lower fidelity than CLI/MCP: paragraph-level diff, no section targeting, no edit summaries

**Agent Attribution** (dual persistence model):
- **CRDT-level**: Lightweight origin tag embedded in each Yjs transaction (author ID + timestamp, ~20 bytes per update). Travels with the CRDT, survives storage and replay. Enables offline attribution.
- **Server-level**: Relay annotates each update with authenticated user/agent ID in `yjs_update_log`. Provides authoritative mapping for history and audit.
- Both layers combined enable: per-section "last edited by" in UI, `scriptum blame` command with full edit summaries, character-level time travel with authorship.
- Contributions flow through to git via `Co-authored-by` trailers (best-effort attribution at git layer).

**Agent Name Policy**:
- Duplicate agent names are allowed. Two agents with the same name share state — their edits are attributed to the same identity.
- This simplifies agent lifecycle: agents are "disposable," and multiple instances of the same agent type (e.g., `claude`) naturally share context.
- For distinct tracking, agents should use unique names (e.g., `claude-auth-reviewer`, `claude-api-writer`).

### 5. Git Sync

Automatic, intelligent syncing to git remotes.

- **Semantic commit groups**: Commits triggered by intent closure (finishing a claimed section, resolving a comment thread, completing a task, explicit checkpoint command). Idle timer (~30 seconds) as fallback only — not the primary commit trigger.
- **AI-generated commit messages**: Analyzes the diff and produces meaningful commit messages (e.g., "Update authentication flow with OAuth2 PKCE details")
- **Configurable remote**: GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, any git remote
- **Branch strategy**: Configurable per workspace - commit to main, to a branch, or create PRs
- **Selective sync**: Choose which documents/folders sync to git
- **Two-tier attribution**: `scriptum blame` shows per-line/per-section attribution from CRDT data (richer than git — includes edit summaries, agent vs human, section context). Git history preserves co-authors via `Co-authored-by` trailers as best-effort.

### 6. Workspace Organization

Abstract workspace layer that's flexible and intuitive.

- **Workspaces**: Top-level containers for related documents
- **Folders**: Hierarchical organization within workspaces
- **Tags**: Cross-cutting labels for documents (e.g., `#rfc`, `#draft`, `#approved`)
- **Backlinks**: `[[wiki-style]]` links between documents for navigation convenience. This is a linking/navigation feature, not a wiki system -- no namespaces, templates, or wiki-specific features.
  - **Syntax**: `[[target]]`, `[[target|display text]]` (alias), `[[target#heading]]` (section link). Obsidian-compatible.
  - **Resolution order**: exact path → filename (case-insensitive) → document title. First match wins.
  - **Index updates**: Re-parsed on file save / git commit (not real-time during editing). Backlinks may be stale for a few seconds during active editing.
  - **Rename handling**: When a document is renamed/moved, all `[[old-name]]` references across the workspace are automatically updated to `[[new-name]]`. Confirmation toast: "Updated N links across M documents." No undo — matches IDE refactoring behavior.
- **Search**: Full-text search across all documents, with filters by tag, author, date
- **Flexible backends**: A workspace can be backed by:
  - A git repo (full sync)
  - A local folder (file system only)
  - Local files are always present -- the relay server is for sync and collaboration, not primary storage

### 7. Version History & Attribution

Full audit trail of every change.

- **CRDT history (recent, V1)**: Character-level, real-time history for the last 90 days. See exactly who typed what, rewind to any point. **Replay architecture**: Snapshot + sequential replay. Scrubbing to time T = load nearest snapshot before T, replay WAL entries until T. With snapshots every 1000 updates, max 1000 ops to replay (~50ms). Requires: update log with timestamps, stable client-ID-to-user mapping (via dual attribution model).
- **Git history (permanent)**: Every auto-commit is a permanent snapshot. Browse with familiar git tools.
- **Timeline view**: Visual timeline of document evolution with contributor avatars
- **Diff view**: Side-by-side or inline diffs between any two versions
- **Restore**: One-click restore to any previous version
- **Per-editor breakdown**: See how much each collaborator (human or agent) contributed

### 8. Permissions & Sharing

Control who can access and edit.

- **Workspace-level permissions**: Owner, Editor, Viewer roles
- **Document-level overrides**: Lock specific docs or grant access to specific people
- **Share links**: Public or password-protected links for external sharing
- **Guest access**: Invite non-users to view/edit specific documents without creating an account

## Non-Goals (V1)

- **Not a wiki**: `[[backlinks]]` are a navigation convenience, not a wiki system. No namespaces, templates, transclusion, or wiki-specific features.
- **Not a CMS**: No publishing pipeline, SEO, or public-facing rendering. No CMS publishing workflows.
- **Not Notion**: No databases, kanban boards, or non-document content types.
- **Not Google Docs**: No suggesting mode, tracked changes, or approval workflows. Comments exist for discussion, not as an approval primitive.
- **No native mobile clients** in V1.
- **No arbitrary binary asset collaboration** in V1.

---

## Success Metrics

- **Time to first collaborative edit**: < 2 minutes from install
- **Sync latency**: < 500ms for CRDT updates between peers
- **Git commit quality**: AI commit messages rated "good" by users >80% of the time
- **Offline resilience**: 100% of offline edits merge without data loss
- **Agent integration**: Claude Code can edit a Scriptum doc with < 5 lines of config

```

**Key layout decisions**:
- **Sidebar**: Linear-style minimal. Workspace switcher dropdown at top. Documents grouped by folder. Tags section. Active agents section. Cmd+K command palette for fast navigation.
- **Editor**: Centered content with Notion-style clean typography (max ~720px content width). Tab bar for open documents (Obsidian-style). Breadcrumb navigation.
- **Status bar**: Sync status (green dot = synced, yellow = syncing, red = offline), cursor position, active editor count.
- **Right panel** (toggleable): Document outline, backlinks, comments. Not visible by default.

### Collaboration Presence (Google Docs-style)

- **Colored cursors** with name labels floating next to cursor position. Label auto-hides after 3s of inactivity, reappears on movement.
- **Avatar stack** in top-right corner showing who's online in this document.
- **Selection highlights**: Each collaborator's text selection shown in their assigned color (translucent highlight).
- **Color assignment**: Deterministic from user/agent name hash. Consistent across sessions.

### Section Lease Indicators

- **Inline badge** next to section heading: `## Authentication [claude-1 editing]`
- Badge color matches the editor's cursor color.
- Badge shows on hover: "Claimed by claude-1: rewriting auth (expires in 8m)"
- Badge disappears when lease expires or is released.

### Reconciliation UI (Notion-style inline)

When the reconciliation trigger fires (>50% section changed by 2+ editors in 30s):

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  ## Authentication                                        │
│                                                           │
│  ┌─ Version by Gary ────────────────────────────────────┐│
│  │ OAuth 2.1 with PKCE is the primary auth flow.        ││
│  │ Users authenticate via GitHub OAuth...                ││
│  └──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘│
│                                                           │
│  ┌─ Version by claude-1 ───────────────────────────────┐│
│  │ Authentication uses OAuth 2.1 + PKCE. The flow      ││
│  │ supports both GitHub and email/password...           ││
│  └──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘│
│                                                           │
│  [ Keep Gary's ] [ Keep claude-1's ] [ Keep Both ]        │
│                                                           │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

- Both versions shown inline, separated by subtle divider with author attribution.
- Resolution happens in the editor — no separate view or modal.
- "Keep Both" inserts both versions sequentially with a separator.
- Resolution triggers a semantic commit.

### Comments (Notion-style inline popover)

- Select text → comment icon appears in right margin.
- Click → popover anchored to selection with comment input.
- Threaded replies within the popover.
- Resolved comments collapse to a subtle indicator (small dot in margin).
- Yellow highlight on text with active comments.

### Search (Obsidian-style panel)

- **Cmd+Shift+F**: Opens search panel in left sidebar (replaces file tree temporarily).
- Full-text search across all workspace documents.
- Results show: file name, matching line with highlighted search term, surrounding context snippet.
- Click result → opens document at match location.
- Filters: by tag, by author, by date range.

### Version History / Time Travel (Obsidian-style timeline slider)

- Accessed via document menu or keyboard shortcut.
- **Horizontal timeline slider** at bottom of editor.
- Drag slider to scrub through document history. Document content updates in real-time as you scrub.
- **Author-colored highlights**: As you scrub, text is colored by who wrote it at that point in time (using collaboration cursor colors).
- **Restore button**: "Restore to this version" creates a new edit reverting to the scrubbed state.
- **Diff toggle**: Switch between "colored authorship" and "diff from current" views.

### Offline / Sync Status

- **Status bar indicator**: Green dot (synced), yellow dot + "Syncing..." (active sync), red dot + "Offline" (disconnected).
- **Offline banner** (web only): Yellow banner at top: "You're offline — changes will sync when reconnected." Web app continues editing using IndexedDB as local CRDT store. Changes queue and merge on reconnect.
- **Desktop offline**: No banner (offline is normal). Status bar shows pending changes count: "● 12 pending". Changes sync automatically on reconnect.
- **Reconnect progress**: After coming online, status bar shows: "Syncing... 847/1,203 updates" with progress.

### Workspace Management

- **Workspace switching**: Dropdown at top of sidebar. Shows all workspaces with last-accessed timestamp.
- **New document**: Cmd+N. Creates untitled doc in current folder. Inline rename.
- **New folder**: Right-click in sidebar → "New Folder".
- **Document actions**: Right-click context menu: Rename, Move, Delete, Copy Link, Add Tag, Archive.
- **Settings**: Accessible from sidebar bottom gear icon. Opens a settings page (not modal) with tabbed sections: General, Git Sync, Agents, Permissions, Appearance.

```

Core architectural decisions:
1. Canonical state is CRDT; markdown is a projection.
2. **Yjs-in-daemon model**: The daemon owns the authoritative Y.Doc and exposes a local WebSocket server (`ws://localhost:{port}`). Desktop/web CodeMirror connects via y-websocket as a standard Yjs provider. CLI and MCP connect as peers over the same local WS. On mobile, the daemon is embedded in-process (same as Tauri desktop mode).
3. Relay assigns monotonic `server_seq` per `(workspace_id, doc_id)`.
4. Local writes are acknowledged only after durable local WAL fsync.
5. Protocol compatibility target is N and N-1 for REST, WS, JSON-RPC.
6. **Web-first onboarding**: Web app is a first-class client. Web users can create workspaces, edit, and collaborate without installing anything (CRDT state on relay). Desktop adds local files, offline mode, CLI, and agent integration. "Local files always present" applies to desktop users only.

**TypeScript Tooling**:

| Concern | Tool | Rationale |
|---------|------|-----------|
| Lint + Format | **Biome** | Single Rust-based tool, ~100x faster than ESLint+Prettier. Handles both linting and formatting with minimal config |
| Test runner | **Vitest** | Vite-native, fast HMR-aware watch mode, Jest-compatible API, native ESM. Already using Vite for build |
| Type checking | **tsc --noEmit** | Standard TypeScript compiler. Biome handles style, tsc handles types |
| Bundling | **Vite** | Already chosen for desktop/web. Handles dev server, HMR, production builds |

**Rust Tooling**:

| Concern | Tool | Rationale |
|---------|------|-----------|
| Lint | **clippy** | Standard Rust linter, catches common mistakes and non-idiomatic code |
| Format | **rustfmt** | Standard Rust formatter, zero-config |
| Test runner | **cargo-nextest** | Parallel test execution, up to 3x faster than `cargo test`. Better output, retries, JUnit XML for CI |
| Coverage | **cargo-llvm-cov** | Source-based coverage via LLVM instrumentation. Accurate, fast |
| Audit | **cargo-deny** | License checking, vulnerability scanning, duplicate crate detection |

**CI (GitHub Actions)**:

| Job | Trigger | Contents |
|-----|---------|----------|
| **Lint & Format** | Every push/PR | `biome check`, `cargo clippy`, `cargo fmt --check`, `tsc --noEmit` |
| **Test (TS)** | Every push/PR | `vitest run` across all TS packages (Turborepo cached) |

## System Architecture

### Availability Model

- **Local plane**: Always available. Offline edits succeed with crash-safe durability (WAL fsync before ack).
- **Collaboration plane**: Depends on relay for cross-device sync. Target >= 99.9% monthly availability.
- **Degraded mode**: When relay is unreachable, local edits queue in outbox. Sync resumes automatically on reconnect.

### Consistency Model

- Per-doc eventual consistency with deterministic convergence.
- Server ordering key: `(workspace_id, doc_id, server_seq BIGINT)`.
- Client dedupe key: `(client_id, client_update_id UUIDv7)`.
- At-least-once delivery; idempotent apply by dedupe key.

### Trust Boundaries

- Local daemon trusts only local OS user identity.
- Relay trusts bearer access token and workspace-scoped session token.
- Share links are capability tokens with bounded scope and expiry.

## Component Design

### 1. CRDT Engine (Yjs)

Every document is a Yjs `Doc` containing:

```typescript
// Yjs document structure
const ydoc = new Y.Doc()

// The markdown content as a collaborative text type
const ytext = ydoc.getText('content')

// Document metadata (title, tags, etc.)
const ymeta = ydoc.getMap('meta')

// Awareness (cursors, presence)
const awareness = new awarenessProtocol.Awareness(ydoc)
```

**Why Yjs over Automerge?**
- CodeMirror 6 has mature Yjs integration (y-codemirror.next)
- y-webrtc and y-websocket are mature
- Smaller wire format (important for real-time)
- Larger ecosystem of providers and bindings
- y-crdt (Rust) bindings for the CLI/backend

**Markdown / CRDT Round-Trip**:

```
CRDT model: Y.Text stores the raw markdown string exactly as typed.
No normalization, no conversion between rich document models.

ytext.toString() === file.md contents  (identity mapping)

This means:
1. File on disk = ytext.toString() = exact markdown content (no normalization, no reformatting; configurable line-ending policy, UTF-8)
2. Editor (CodeMirror 6) renders live preview via custom extension:
   - Active line shows raw markdown (for editing)
   - Unfocused lines render as rich text (for reading)
   - The live preview NEVER alters the stored text
3. Edits in the editor produce CodeMirror transactions → y-codemirror.next
   converts them to Yjs text ops
4. File watcher edits produce text diffs → converted to Yjs text ops
5. Both pathways produce Yjs operations → CRDT merges them

The key insight: Yjs is the source of truth, not the file. The file is a
projection of the Yjs state. Because Y.Text stores raw markdown, there
is no lossy conversion — exact formatting is preserved, including
whitespace, indentation style, and line endings.

Reference: codemirror-markdown-hybrid (MIT) for the hybrid rendering approach.
```

### 2. Section Awareness Layer

*(Design informed by [Niwa](https://github.com/secemp9/niwa)'s heading-based document tree and per-section conflict detection)*

A lightweight overlay that parses markdown structure and provides section-level intelligence. Unlike Niwa (which uses sections as the unit of conflict resolution), Scriptum uses sections as the unit of **awareness** - the CRDT handles the actual merging.

**Why this hybrid?** Pure CRDT merges can produce surprising results in prose (e.g., two people rewriting the same paragraph get both versions interleaved). Section awareness lets us warn users/agents *before* this happens, without blocking edits.

```typescript
interface SectionAwareness {
  // Parse document into heading-based section tree (like Niwa's node tree)
  parseSections(markdown: string): Section[]

  // Track which editors are in which sections (cursor position → section)
  getEditorSections(awareness: Awareness): Map<clientId, Section>

  // Detect when multiple editors are in the same section
  getSectionOverlaps(): SectionOverlap[]

  // Non-blocking callbacks when overlap detected
  onSectionOverlap(callback: (overlap: SectionOverlap) => void): void

  // Get per-section edit attribution history
  getSectionHistory(sectionId: string): SectionEdit[]
}

interface Section {
  id: string              // Stable ID: "h2:authentication" or "h2_3" (Niwa-style fallback)
  heading: string         // "## Authentication"
  level: number           // 2
  startOffset: number     // Character offset in Yjs text
  endOffset: number       // Character offset of next section
  parentId: string        // Parent section ID (builds a tree, like Niwa)
  children: string[]      // Child section IDs
  lastEditedBy: string    // Most recent editor (human or agent name)
  lastEditedAt: Date
  editCount: number       // Total edits to this section
}

interface SectionOverlap {
  section: Section
  editors: Array<{
    name: string           // Agent/user name
    type: 'human' | 'agent'
    cursorOffset: number   // Where they're editing within the section
    lastEditAt: Date
  }>
  severity: 'info' | 'warning'  // info = same section, warning = same paragraph
}

interface SectionEdit {
  editorName: string
  editorType: 'human' | 'agent'
  timestamp: Date
  summary?: string         // From --summary flag (agents) or auto-generated
  characterDelta: number   // +/- characters changed
}
```

**Section parsing approach**:
- **Parser**: pulldown-cmark (Rust). Strict mode: only ATX headings (`#` style) are section boundaries. Headings inside code blocks and HTML are ignored.
- Build a tree: headings at level N are children of the nearest preceding heading at level N-1
- Content between headings belongs to the preceding heading's section
- **Slug algorithm**: lowercase, strip non-alphanumeric, hyphenate spaces. Fallback: `h{level}_{index}` for duplicate headings
- Re-parse on every CRDT update (fast - just heading extraction, not full render)

**How it integrates with Yjs:**
```
Yjs text update arrives
    │
    ▼
Re-parse section boundaries from updated markdown
    │
    ▼
Diff section tree against previous parse
    │
    ├── New section? → Track it
    ├── Removed section? → Archive attribution
    ├── Content changed? → Update lastEditedBy from Yjs awareness origin
    └── Multiple editors in same section? → Emit SectionOverlap event
```

This layer does NOT prevent concurrent edits (CRDT handles merging). It provides **awareness** - subtle UI indicators when two people are editing the same section, and richer attribution for the agent CLI.

**Daemon behavior**: Rebuilds heading tree after committed transaction. Stable `section_id = slug(ancestor_chain)+ordinal_suffix`. Emits awareness only, never blocks writes.

### 3. Daemon Architecture (Hybrid Embedded / Standalone)

The Scriptum daemon (`scriptumd`) is a Rust process that owns all local collaboration state. It uses a hybrid architecture: it can run embedded in-process or as a standalone background process. One daemon per OS user, exposing JSON-RPC over user-scoped Unix socket (macOS/Linux) or named pipe (Windows).

```

**Key details:**
- **Debouncing**: 100ms debounce on file events to batch rapid saves (configurable 50-500ms)
- **Hash tracking**: SHA-256 hash of file content to detect actual changes vs. no-op saves
- **Watcher pausing**: When writing remote changes to disk, temporarily ignore file events to prevent feedback loops
- **Diff algorithm**: Uses `diff-match-patch` or similar to compute minimal edits, converted to Yjs text operations. Patch-based (not whole-doc replace) for efficiency with concurrent edits.
- **Diff correctness testing**: Both property-based tests (randomized edits, verify CRDT convergence) and golden file tests (curated tricky scenarios: multi-hunk, overlapping, Unicode, empty sections). Golden tests on every commit, property tests nightly.
- **Path safety**: Canonicalize all paths, reject directory traversal and symlink escape attempts
- **Path normalization**: Separators to `/`, Unicode NFKC, reject `.`/`..`, max 512 characters

**Diff-to-Yjs Conversion:**

```typescript
function applyFileChangeToYjs(oldContent: string, newContent: string, ytext: Y.Text) {
  // Use Myers diff or similar to get minimal edit operations
  const patches = diffMatchPatch.patch_make(oldContent, newContent)

  // Convert patches to Yjs operations
  ydoc.transact(() => {
    let offset = 0
    for (const patch of patches) {
      const start = patch.start1 + offset

      for (const [op, text] of patch.diffs) {
        if (op === DIFF_DELETE) {
          ytext.delete(start, text.length)
          offset -= text.length
        } else if (op === DIFF_INSERT) {
          ytext.insert(start, text)
          offset += text.length
        }
        // DIFF_EQUAL: advance position
      }
    }
  }, 'file-watcher')  // Origin tag for identifying source of change
}
```

**Git Sync Worker details:**
- **Semantic triggers (primary)**: Section lease release, comment thread resolved, task completed, explicit `scriptum checkpoint` command. These produce meaningful, intent-aligned commits.
- **Idle fallback**: After 30s of inactivity with uncommitted changes, auto-commit as a safety net. Not the primary commit path.
- Max 1 auto-commit per 30s per workspace
- Push policies: `disabled` | `manual` | `auto_rebase`
- AI commit messages: opt-in, redact before API call per workspace policy, deterministic fallback on failure
- **Leader election**: One daemon per workspace is elected git sync leader via relay-mediated protocol. If the leader disconnects, another connected daemon takes over automatically. Prevents multi-writer race conditions (competing commits, forced merges). Leader handles both commit and push operations.

**AI Commit Message Generation:**

```typescript
async function generateCommitMessage(changes: FileChange[]): Promise<string> {
  const diffSummary = changes.map(c => {
    const stats = `+${c.additions}/-${c.deletions}`
    return `${c.status} ${c.path} (${stats}): ${c.sectionsSummary}`
  }).join('\n')

  const response = await claude.messages.create({
    model: 'claude-haiku-4-5-20250929',
    max_tokens: 200,
    system: `Generate a concise git commit message (max 72 chars for first line).
             Focus on WHAT changed and WHY, not HOW. Use imperative mood.
             If multiple files changed, summarize the overall intent.`,
    messages: [{
      role: 'user',
      content: `Generate a commit message for these changes:\n\n${diffSummary}`
    }]
  })

  return response.content[0].text
}

### 7. Agent State Management

Key Niwa insight: agents lose context (sub-agent spawns, context compaction, crashes). The daemon must persist agent state so they can recover.

│     - Uses signaling server for initial handshake                 │
│     - If peers are on same LAN, use mDNS for zero-config         │
│     - WebRTC is an optimization for lower latency, not            │

│     - Single source of truth when peers disagree                  │
│                                                                   │

**Relay Services**: auth, metadata API, sync session manager, update sequencer, snapshot compactor.

**Relay CRDT Management**: Full Y.Doc in memory (via y-crdt Rust) for active documents. Validates updates, generates snapshots, serves current state. Inactive documents unloaded (reload from snapshot + update log on next subscribe).

**Update Sequencer**: In-memory atomic counter per `(workspace_id, doc_id)`. Batch-flush to PostgreSQL periodically. Gaps in sequence are acceptable — clients handle via dedupe key `(client_id, client_update_id)`. Counter is recovered from `MAX(server_seq)` on startup.

**Relay Persistence**: PostgreSQL for metadata + update index, object storage for large snapshots.

# Part 3: API Contracts

## Common Conventions

| Convention | Detail |
|---|---|
| Base path | `/v1` |
| Content type | `application/json` |
| Auth | `Authorization: Bearer <access_token>` |
| Idempotency | Mutating `POST` requires `Idempotency-Key` header (except `/auth/*`) |
| Conditional writes | `PATCH`/`DELETE` require `If-Match` header; missing returns `428 Precondition Required` |
| Pagination | Cursor-based: `limit` + opaque `cursor` parameter |
| Error envelope | `{ "error": { "code": "<ERROR_CODE>", "message": "...", "retryable": bool, "request_id": "...", "details": {} } }` |

  "resume_token": "opaque-resume-token",
  "resume_expires_at": "2025-01-15T10:10:00Z"
}
```

### WebSocket Protocol (`scriptum-sync.v1`)

**Connection**: Frame limit max 262,144 bytes. Heartbeat ping every 15s; disconnect if no pong within 10s.

**Resume token**: TTL 10 min, single-use, bound to `(session_id, workspace_id, client_id, device_id)`.

**Message types**:

| Type | Direction | Fields |
|------|-----------|--------|
| `hello` | client -> server | `type`, `session_token`, `resume_token?` |
| `hello_ack` | server -> client | `type`, `server_time`, `resume_accepted` |
| `subscribe` | client -> server | `type`, `doc_id`, `last_server_seq?` |
| `yjs_update` | bidirectional | `type`, `doc_id`, `client_id`, `client_update_id`, `base_server_seq`, `payload_b64` |
| `ack` | server -> client | `type`, `doc_id`, `client_update_id`, `server_seq`, `applied` |
| `snapshot` | server -> client | `type`, `doc_id`, `snapshot_seq`, `payload_b64` |
| `awareness_update` | bidirectional | `type`, `doc_id`, `peers: [...]` |
| `error` | server -> client | `type`, `code`, `message`, `retryable`, `doc_id?` |

**Dedupe**: Client sends `(client_id, client_update_id UUIDv7)` with every update. Server deduplicates by this key. At-least-once delivery; idempotent apply.

## MCP Tool Contract

MCP tools mirror the daemon JSON-RPC interface. Each tool connects to `scriptumd` via the local socket.

| MCP Tool | Daemon RPC | Description |
|----------|-----------|-------------|
| `scriptum_read` | `doc.read` | Read document content, optionally scoped to section |
| `scriptum_edit` | `doc.edit` | Apply content edits with attribution |
| `scriptum_list` | `doc.tree` | List workspace documents |
| `scriptum_tree` | `doc.sections` | Show document section structure with IDs |
| `scriptum_status` | `agent.status` | Agent's active sessions and sections |
| `scriptum_conflicts` | `agent.conflicts` | Section overlap warnings |
| `scriptum_history` | `doc.diff` | Version timeline / diffs |
| `scriptum_subscribe` | (notification channel) | Change notifications for watched docs |
| `scriptum_agents` | `agent.list` | List active agents in workspace |
| `scriptum_claim` | `agent.claim` | Claim a section with advisory lease (TTL, mode, note) |
| `scriptum_bundle` | `doc.bundle` | Get optimally-sized context bundle for a section |

**MCP Resources**:
- `scriptum://docs/{id}` -- document content
- `scriptum://docs/{id}/sections` -- section tree
- `scriptum://workspace` -- workspace listing
- `scriptum://agents` -- active agent list

## Local Document Metadata Schema (legacy/extended)

This schema extends `meta.db` with higher-level document metadata for the desktop/web app:

```sql
CREATE TABLE documents (
    id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    path TEXT NOT NULL,           -- Relative path in workspace (e.g., "docs/auth.md")
    title TEXT,
    created_at DATETIME,
    updated_at DATETIME,
    last_edited_by TEXT,          -- Agent/user name
    word_count INTEGER,
    git_synced_at DATETIME,      -- Last git commit timestamp
    git_commit_hash TEXT          -- Last git commit hash
);

CREATE TABLE tags (
    doc_id TEXT REFERENCES documents(id),
    tag TEXT NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE backlinks (
    source_doc_id TEXT REFERENCES documents(id),
    target_doc_id TEXT REFERENCES documents(id),
    link_text TEXT               -- The [[link text]] used
);

CREATE TABLE edit_sessions (
    id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    doc_id TEXT REFERENCES documents(id),
    editor_name TEXT,            -- Human name or agent ID
    editor_type TEXT,            -- 'human', 'agent', 'unknown'
    started_at DATETIME,
    ended_at DATETIME,
    sections_edited TEXT,        -- JSON array of section IDs
    summary TEXT                 -- AI-generated or user-provided
);
```

## CRDT Storage Layout & Retention

```
.scriptum/crdt_store/
├── wal/
│   ├── {doc_id}.wal           # Append-only write-ahead log
│   │   Format: [length:u32][checksum:u32][yjs_update:bytes]*
│   │   - New Yjs updates appended atomically
│   │   - fsync before acknowledging local write
│   └── ...
├── snapshots/
│   ├── {doc_id}.snap          # Compressed Yjs state snapshot
│   │   - Created every 1000 updates or 10 min
│   │   - Contains full merged Yjs document state
│   └── ...
└── (lock files for concurrent access)

Recovery procedure:
1. Load latest snapshot for document
2. Replay WAL entries after snapshot's sequence number
3. If checksum validation fails, mark document as degraded
4. Degraded documents still accept writes but show warning in UI
```

**Retention (relay)**:
- Keep updates for 90 days.
- Snapshot every 1,000 updates or 10 minutes.
- Compact (delete) updates older than the latest-2 snapshots.
- Audit events: 180 days hot storage, archive per tenant beyond that.

# Part 5: Operations

## Security Considerations

### Authentication
- **OAuth 2.1 + PKCE**: Primary auth flow for web and desktop. GitHub OAuth as initial provider.
- **Optional password**: Argon2id hashed, for users who prefer email/password.
- **Access tokens**: 15-minute JWT, workspace-scoped.
- **Refresh tokens**: 30-day rotating, single-use. Stored as hashed values. Reuse detection revokes entire token family.
- **Desktop auth**: OAuth device flow or browser-redirect flow via Tauri deep links.
- **Agent auth**: CLI/MCP connect to local daemon; daemon authenticates to relay with stored credentials.

### Authorization
- **Workspace RBAC**: Owner, Editor, Viewer roles enforced on every REST route and WebSocket `subscribe`.
- **Document ACL overrides**: Per-document role grants for specific users/agents, with optional expiry.
- **Enforcement point**: Relay server checks permissions before processing any operation.

### Share Links
- 128-bit random token, stored hashed (never in plaintext).
- Optional Argon2id password protection.
- Bounded by: max uses, expiry time, disabled flag.
- Rate limiting on redeem endpoint to prevent brute-force.

### Input Validation
- Strict JSON schema validation on all endpoints.
- REST body max 1 MiB.
- WebSocket frame max 256 KiB.
- Path canonicalization on all file operations.
- Markdown XSS sanitization allowlist for rendered content.

### Transport & Storage
- TLS 1.2+ required (1.3 preferred) for all relay connections.
- Encryption at rest for stored CRDT data and database.
- OS keychain for local secrets (API keys, git credentials, tokens) -- never in config files.
- Local CRDT state files readable only by owning user (0600 permissions).

### Audit
- Immutable append-only audit events for: auth, permission changes, share link operations, deletes, admin actions.
- PII minimized: IP addresses and user agents stored as hashes, not raw values.
- Retention: 180 days hot, archive per tenant configuration.

### Encryption Model
- **V1: Server-readable**. Relay can read document content. This enables: server-side search, share link rendering, server-side AI features, and easier debugging. Standard SaaS model.
- **V2: E2EE opt-in**. Storage layer is designed so end-to-end encryption can be layered on per-workspace for enterprise/privacy-sensitive users. When E2EE is enabled: relay stores opaque blobs, server-side search is disabled, share links require client-side decryption.
- **Migration path**: E2EE workspaces are a separate mode, not a global toggle. Existing server-readable workspaces are unaffected.

### AI Safety
- Per-workspace redaction policy for AI commit messages: `disabled` (no AI) | `redacted` (sanitized diff) | `full` (complete diff).
- Redaction strips sensitive patterns (API keys, secrets, credentials) before sending to Claude API.

## Error Handling Strategy

### Error Code Registry

| Error Code | HTTP Status | Description | Retryable |
|---|---|---|---|
| `VALIDATION_FAILED` | 400 | Request body fails schema validation | No |
| `IDEMPOTENCY_KEY_REQUIRED` | 400 | Mutating POST missing Idempotency-Key header | No |
| `AUTH_INVALID_TOKEN` | 401 | Access token expired, malformed, or invalid | No (refresh) |
| `AUTH_TOKEN_REVOKED` | 401 | Refresh token has been revoked | No (re-auth) |
| `AUTH_STATE_MISMATCH` | 401 | OAuth state parameter mismatch | No |
| `AUTH_CODE_INVALID` | 401 | OAuth authorization code invalid or expired | No |
| `SYNC_TOKEN_EXPIRED` | 401 | WebSocket session token expired | No (new session) |
| `AUTH_FORBIDDEN` | 403 | Caller lacks required role/permission | No |
| `NOT_FOUND` | 404 | Resource does not exist or caller cannot see it | No |
| `DOC_PATH_CONFLICT` | 409 | Document path already exists in workspace | No |
| `GIT_PUSH_REJECTED` | 409 | Git remote rejected push (non-fast-forward) | Yes (rebase) |
| `IDEMPOTENCY_REPLAY_MISMATCH` | 409 | Same idempotency key with different request body | No |
| `EDIT_PRECONDITION_FAILED` | 412 | `if_etag` or `if_version` does not match current state | No (re-read) |
| `YJS_UPDATE_TOO_LARGE` | 413 | Yjs update payload exceeds max frame size | No |
| `PRECONDITION_REQUIRED` | 428 | PATCH/DELETE missing required `If-Match` header | No |
| `RATE_LIMITED` | 429 | Too many requests; check `Retry-After` header | Yes |
| `INTERNAL_ERROR` | 500 | Unexpected server error | Yes |
| `AI_COMMIT_UNAVAILABLE` | 503 | Claude API unreachable; deterministic fallback used | Yes |
| `DISK_WRITE_FAILED` | 507 | Local daemon failed to write to disk | Yes |

### Retry Policy
- **Transient errors** (429, 500, 503): Exponential backoff 250ms..30s, max 8 attempts.
- **Dead letter**: After exceeding retry policy thresholds, updates are moved to dead-letter queue for manual intervention.
- **Deterministic fallback**: When AI commit generation fails, use structured fallback message: `"Update {n} file(s): {paths}"`.

---

## Performance Requirements / SLAs

**Benchmark assumptions**: M2 16GB client, 4vCPU/16GB relay + dedicated PostgreSQL, 40ms RTT, <=4KiB median / <=32KiB p95 update payloads.

| Metric | Target | Approach |
|--------|--------|----------|
| Editor keystroke latency | < 16ms | Local-first CRDT, async sync |
| Local edit apply (500KB doc) | <= 12ms p95 | Yjs binary encoding, Rust y-crdt |
| File watcher response (<=256KB) | <= 250ms p95 | fsevents (macOS) / inotify (Linux), debounce |
| Client-to-relay ack (same region) | <= 500ms p95 | WebSocket, binary encoding |
| CRDT sync latency (P2P) | < 100ms | WebRTC data channels |
| CRDT sync latency (relay) | < 300ms | WebSocket, binary encoding |
| Reconnect catch-up (10k updates) | <= 2s p95 | Snapshot within 1000 updates |
| Metadata API | <= 200ms p95, <= 500ms p99 | PostgreSQL with proper indexing |
| Git commit generation | < 2s | Claude Haiku for commit messages (fast, cheap) |
| Desktop app startup | < 1s | Tauri, lazy document loading |
| Desktop app memory | < 100MB | Rust backend, efficient CRDT encoding |
| Web app initial load | < 2s | Code splitting, edge CDN |
| Relay availability | >= 99.9% monthly | Multi-AZ deployment, health checks |
| Sync success rate | >= 99.95% monthly | At-least-once delivery, outbox queue |
| Capacity per pod | 1000 concurrent sessions | Horizontal scaling behind load balancer |
| Sustained throughput | 50 updates/sec/doc | Sequencer with batched writes |

---

## Observability

### Logging
- **Format**: Structured JSON logs.
- **Fields**: `request_id`, `workspace_id`, actor hash (not raw PII), endpoint, error code, latency.
- **Retention**: 30 days hot, 180 days cold/archived.

### Metrics
- **RED metrics**: Rate, Errors, Duration for all API and WebSocket endpoints.
- **Custom metrics**:
  - `sync_ack_latency_ms` -- time from client update to server ack
  - `outbox_depth` -- pending updates per workspace
  - `daemon_recovery_time_ms` -- time to reload state on crash recovery
  - `git_sync_jobs_total` -- by state (queued/running/completed/failed)
  - `sequence_gap_count` -- detected gaps in server_seq ordering

### Tracing
- **OpenTelemetry** spans across API handler, sequencer, DB queries, object storage operations.
- Trace ID propagated through REST, WebSocket, and daemon JSON-RPC calls.

### Alerting

| Alert | Condition | Severity | Response |
|-------|-----------|----------|----------|
| Availability drop | < 99.5% over 15 min window | Page | Runbook: check health endpoints, scale pods |
| Sync error spike | > 1% sync errors over 10 min | Page | Runbook: check sequencer, DB connections |
| Outbox growth | 10x growth over 15 min | Page | Runbook: check relay connectivity, outbox backpressure |
| Latency breach | p95 exceeds target for 3 hours | Ticket | Runbook: profile hot paths, check DB queries |

Every paging alert must have an associated runbook before going to production.

---

## Testing Strategy

| Category | Scope | Frequency |
|----------|-------|-----------|
| **Unit** | Parser, sequencer, auth, ACL logic | Every commit |
| **Property** | CRDT convergence (10k-op randomized scenarios), diff-to-Yjs correctness (randomized file edits → verify CRDT state) | Nightly |
| **Golden file** | Diff-to-Yjs edge cases: multi-hunk patches, overlapping edits, Unicode, empty sections, large replacements | Every commit |
| **Integration** | Daemon+watcher, relay+WS, git worker, snapshot/recovery | Every PR |
| **Contract** | REST vs OpenAPI spec, WS frame schemas, JSON-RPC, MCP parity | Every PR |
| **UI visual** | Playwright screenshot baselines for key screens (editor, sidebar, presence, overlaps, sync status). Chromium canonical; strict pixel threshold. | Every PR |
| **UI structural** | Playwright ARIA snapshots for all views — machine-readable accessibility tree baselines that agents can diff textually | Every PR |
| **UI layout/token** | Computed geometry + CSS token assertions for critical elements (spacing, typography, design system compliance) | Every PR |
| **Security** | AuthZ bypass, path traversal, XSS, token replay, brute-force | Every PR + periodic pen test |
| **Load** | 1000 sessions, 50 updates/sec/doc, 1hr soak | Weekly / pre-release |
| **Compatibility** | N and N-1 client/server version matrix | Every release |

**Release gate**: No P0/P1 bugs open, contract and security tests at 100%, SLO benchmarks pass, UI visual + structural baselines pass.

### UI Testing & Visual Regression

The highest-risk UI surfaces in Scriptum (CodeMirror hybrid live preview, presence overlays, CRDT sync states) require more than unit tests — they need visual and structural verification that agents can run in a tight loop.

**Three correctness contracts:**

1. **Visual (pixel regression)**: Screenshot baselines for every key screen state. Playwright `toHaveScreenshot()` against Chromium as the canonical environment. Strict pixel threshold (zero diff for canonical, slightly looser for secondary engines if needed).
2. **Structural (ARIA tree)**: Playwright ARIA snapshots (`toMatchAriaSnapshot`) for every view. Produces a stable YAML artifact that agents can reason about textually — no image inspection needed. Also enforces accessibility correctness.
3. **Layout/design tokens**: A small Playwright helper extracts a JSON "layout contract" for critical elements (bounding boxes, font size/weight, key Tailwind CSS variables) and snapshots it with `toMatchSnapshot`. Catches "button shifted 4px" issues without relying purely on pixel diffs, and gives agents an interpretable textual diff.

**Fixture mode (test-only):**

The app exposes a fixture mode (enabled via environment variable, stripped from production builds) that makes UI states fully deterministic:

- Disables all CSS animations/transitions and CodeMirror caret blinking
- Freezes `Date.now()` and locale/timezone formatting
- Removes randomness from IDs, avatar colors, relative timestamps ("3 min ago" → fixed)
- Pins fonts (bundled with app, not OS-dependent) for cross-platform screenshot stability
- Uses fixed viewport sizes and device scale factors

**Test harness API** (available in fixture mode only):

```typescript
// Set complex UI states instantly without slow click-paths
window.__SCRIPTUM_TEST__ = {
  loadFixture(name: string): void           // Load a named fixture (e.g., 'overlap-warning')
  setDocContent(markdown: string): void     // Set document content directly
  setCursor(pos: {line: number, ch: number}): void
  spawnRemotePeer(peer: {name: string, type: 'human'|'agent', cursor: {line: number, ch: number}, section?: string}): void
  setGitStatus(status: {dirty: boolean, ahead: number, behind: number, lastCommit?: string}): void
  setSyncState(state: 'synced'|'offline'|'reconnecting'|'error'): void
  setCommentThreads(threads: CommentThread[]): void
}
```

This is the difference between tests that take 8 minutes and flake, and tests that take 30-90 seconds and are stable enough for agents to rely on.

**High-risk UI surfaces requiring golden baselines:**

1. **CodeMirror hybrid live preview**: Fixtures with representative markdown (headings, lists, tables, links, code, task lists). Assert "active line shows raw markdown" vs "inactive line renders rich" via visual baseline + DOM assertion. Stabilization: disable caret blink, disable smooth scroll, pin monospace font, fix editor width and wrap mode.
2. **Presence + section overlap overlays**: Spawn remote peers with deterministic colors/positions. Assert cursor labels render correctly, presence list shows correct names/types, section overlap severity changes (info vs warning), attribution badges render correctly (agent vs human).
3. **Sync/offline state indicators**: Deterministic sync states (offline banner, reconnecting, synced indicator, conflict/overlap warnings, git commit pending/last commit display).

**Tauri desktop testing strategy:**

- **Visual correctness**: Proved on the web build with Playwright (Chromium). Tauri on macOS uses WKWebView which has no WebDriver support — do not attempt macOS desktop visual tests.
- **Desktop-specific correctness**: WebDriver tests on Windows/Linux for Tauri-only features: file dialogs, daemon IPC wiring, file watcher integration, window/menu shortcuts.

**Agent-friendly test commands:**

| Command | Scope | Target |
|---------|-------|--------|
| `pnpm test:ui:smoke` | 10-20 key fixtures + ARIA snapshots (Chromium only) | < 2 min |
| `pnpm test:ui` | Full Playwright suite (Chromium + optional WebKit) | < 10 min |
| `pnpm test:ui:update` | Update baselines (only when explicitly invoked) | — |

Playwright configured to retain on failure: trace, screenshot diffs, video (optional). Agents get exact visual diffs to iterate against.

---

## Deployment Strategy

### Versioning
- Semver per component (daemon, CLI, desktop, relay, MCP server).
- Protocol compatibility: N and N-1 versions supported simultaneously.

### Hosted Relay
1. Feature flags gate new functionality.
2. Additive database migration applied first.
3. 5% canary for 30 minutes.
4. 50% rollout for 60 minutes.
5. 100% rollout.
6. Auto-rollback triggers: crash rate +2x baseline OR error rate > 1%.

### Desktop / CLI
- Ring deployment: internal -> beta -> GA.
- Kill-switch on crash regression (>2x baseline crash rate).
- Auto-update with user consent.

### Database Migrations
- Expand-only migrations (add columns, tables, indexes).
- Contract (drop old columns/tables) only in a later release after all clients have upgraded.
- Every migration includes pre/post validation checks and a rollback script.

---

## Migration Plan

### Import (New Workspace from Existing Files)
1. Scan `.md` files recursively.
2. Normalize UTF-8 (handle BOM), preserve line endings.
3. Initialize CRDT at `seq=0` for each document.
4. Build indexes (backlinks, tags, FTS).
5. Detect path collisions via `path_norm` uniqueness.

### Schema Migrations
- **Pattern**: Expand -> Backfill -> Switch -> Contract.
- Each phase has pre-checks (data integrity) and post-checks (no regression).
- Rollback script tested before applying forward migration.

### Protocol Versioning
- Client sends protocol version on connect (`scriptum-sync.v1`).
- Server rejects unsupported versions with `UPGRADE_REQUIRED` error.
- N-1 support maintained for at least one release cycle.

### Validation
- Post-migration verification: document counts, path uniqueness, sequence continuity.
- Automated comparison of pre/post migration state checksums.

# Part 6: Planning

## Phase 0: Integration Spike (Sequential — 1 engineer)

Must complete before any parallel work begins. Validates the core architecture.

- [ ] **Critical path validation**: CodeMirror (JS) edits a doc via y-websocket connecting to daemon's local WS server. CLI (Rust) edits the same doc via y-crdt. Both converge. Persistence works across daemon restarts. This spike de-risks the Yjs-in-daemon architecture before building anything else.

---

## Phases 1-2: Foundation + Collaboration (4 parallel tracks)

### Track A: Daemon (Rust)
- [ ] CRDT engine (y-crdt Rust bindings)
- [ ] Local WebSocket server — dual endpoints: `/yjs` (Yjs binary sync protocol) + `/rpc` (JSON-RPC)

- [ ] WAL + snapshot persistence (fsync before ack, snapshot every 1000 updates)
- [ ] Intent/lease storage (in-memory + SQLite, TTL-only lifecycle)
- [ ] Outbox queue (exponential backoff, 10k update / 1GiB bounds)
- [ ] Golden file tests for diff-to-Yjs edge cases

### Track B: Relay Server (Rust/Axum)
- [ ] Axum scaffold + REST API (auth, workspaces, members, documents)

- [ ] Per-element rendering: headings, bold/italic, links, images, code blocks, tables, task lists, blockquotes, horizontal rules
- [ ] Active line = raw markdown, unfocused lines = rich text preview
- [ ] Collaboration: y-codemirror.next integration, remote cursors with name labels (Google Docs-style)
- [ ] Selection highlights (per-collaborator color, deterministic from name hash)
- [ ] Lease badge rendering: `[agent-name editing]` inline badge next to section heading
- [ ] Reconciliation inline UI: detect trigger (>50% section changed by 2+ editors in 30s), show both versions with Keep A / Keep B / Keep Both
- [ ] Slash commands: `/table`, `/code`, `/image`, `/callout`

### Track D: App Shell (TypeScript/React)
- [ ] React scaffold + routing (shared between desktop and web)
- [ ] Sidebar: Linear-style minimal (workspace dropdown, document tree, tags, agents section)
- [ ] Tab bar + breadcrumb navigation (Obsidian-style)
- [ ] Status bar (sync indicator: green/yellow/red, cursor position, active editor count)
- [ ] Cmd+K command palette (fast navigation)
- [ ] Zustand state management (Yjs reactive updates → React)
- [ ] Fixture mode + test harness API (`__SCRIPTUM_TEST__`) — build early
- [ ] Playwright smoke suite: 5-10 golden screens + ARIA snapshots
- [ ] Auth flow for web (GitHub OAuth callback, session persistence)
- [ ] Offline: IndexedDB CRDT store for web, yellow banner, reconnect progress

---

## Phase 3: Git Sync + CLI (3 parallel tracks)

### Track E: Git Sync Worker (Rust, inside daemon)
- [ ] Shell out to `git` CLI (uses existing user auth — SSH keys, credential helpers, `gh auth`)
- [ ] Git leader election (lease-based via relay: TTL 60s, auto-renew, failover on expiry)

- [ ] All commands → daemon JSON-RPC: `read`, `edit`, `tree`, `sections`, `search`, `diff`, `ls`, `blame`, `claim`, `bundle`
- [ ] Agent state commands: `whoami`, `status`, `conflicts`, `agents`
- [ ] `--section` edit semantics: replace section body (heading preserved)
- [ ] Output format: TTY auto-detect (human text vs JSON)
- [ ] Exit codes: 0=success, 1=error, 2=usage, 10=daemon down, 11=auth, 12=conflict, 13=network
- [ ] `scriptum setup claude` — install hooks into `.claude/settings.json`

### Track G: Desktop App (Tauri)
- [ ] Tauri 2.0 scaffold
- [ ] Embedded daemon (linked as Rust library, in-process)
- [ ] Wire up editor package + app shell
- [ ] Desktop-specific: file dialogs, menu bar, keyboard shortcuts, system tray
- [ ] Auto-update (Tauri updater with user consent)
- [ ] Git history browsing in the UI

---

## Phase 4: Agent Integration (2 parallel tracks)

### Track H: MCP Server (TypeScript)
- [ ] All MCP tools → daemon JSON-RPC: `scriptum_read`, `scriptum_edit`, `scriptum_tree`, `scriptum_status`, `scriptum_conflicts`, `scriptum_claim`, `scriptum_bundle`
- [ ] MCP resources: `scriptum://docs/{id}`, `scriptum://docs/{id}/sections`, `scriptum://workspace`, `scriptum://agents`
- [ ] Polling change token (no push over stdio). `scriptum_status` returns `change_token`.
- [ ] Agent name from MCP client config (fallback: `mcp-agent`)
- [ ] stdio transport

### Track I: Agent Polish
- [ ] Context bundling: `scriptum_bundle` with tiktoken-rs (cl100k_base) token counting, truncation priority: comments → backlinks → children → parents
- [ ] Claude Code hooks: SessionStart, PreCompact, PreToolUse, PostToolUse, Stop
- [ ] Agent attribution UI (name badges, contribution indicators, per-section "last edited by")
- [ ] End-to-end agent flow testing (Claude Code + MCP → daemon → CRDT → file → git)

---

## Phase 5: Polish & Launch (3 parallel tracks)

### Track J: History & Replay
- [ ] Replay engine: snapshot + sequential WAL replay (max 1000 ops per scrub, ~50ms)
- [ ] Timeline slider UI (Obsidian-style horizontal slider at bottom of editor)
- [ ] Author-colored highlights during scrub (collaboration cursor colors)
- [ ] Diff toggle: "colored authorship" vs "diff from current" views
- [ ] Restore to version

### Track K: Search + Backlinks
- [ ] Full-text search index (SQLite FTS5, behind abstraction layer)
- [ ] Search panel (Cmd+Shift+F, Obsidian-style: file matches, highlighted snippets, filters)
- [ ] Backlink parsing (`[[wiki-style]]` link extraction from markdown)
- [ ] Backlink resolution (link text → document ID, update on edit/rename)
- [ ] Backlinks panel in right sidebar

### Track L: Comments + Permissions + Launch
- [ ] Comment threads (relay DB + REST endpoints)
- [ ] Inline comment UI (Notion-style popover anchored to selection, threaded replies, resolve/collapse)
- [ ] RBAC enforcement (owner/editor/viewer on every route + WebSocket subscribe)
- [ ] Document ACL overrides
- [ ] Share links (128-bit token, hashed storage, password-optional, max uses, expiry)
- [ ] Settings page (tabbed: General, Git Sync, Agents, Permissions, Appearance)
- [ ] Documentation & onboarding
- [ ] Performance optimization & load testing
- [ ] Property-based diff-to-Yjs tests (nightly)

## Open Questions

1. **Large documents**: Yjs performance degrades with very large documents (>1MB). Strategy: chunked updates vs sharding? Document size limit? Auto-splitting into sections? Lazy loading of CRDT state?

2. **CRDT tombstone compaction**: Yjs accumulates tombstones. Strategy for periodic garbage collection without breaking sync with long-offline peers?

3. ~~**Character-level attribution**~~ **RESOLVED**: Dual persistence model (CRDT-level origin tags + server-side update log). Retention: 90 days for update log, snapshots every 1000 updates.

4. **Mobile**: No mobile app in V1. When we add it (V2), daemon is embedded in-process (same as Tauri desktop mode) with local WS server. React Native vs native TBD.

5. **Tenant-level retention**: Custom retention policies and legal hold support for enterprise/hosted deployments.

6. **Pricing model**: Open-source relay server + hosted option. Per-user? Per-workspace? Free tier?

7. ~~**Full-text search index**~~ **RESOLVED**: SQLite FTS5 for V1 (zero additional deps, already using SQLite via meta.db). Swap to Tantivy later if search quality becomes a user complaint. Search is behind an abstraction layer either way.

8. ~~**Backlinks parsing/resolution**~~ **RESOLVED**: `[[target]]`, `[[target|alias]]`, `[[target#heading]]` syntax (Obsidian-compatible). Resolution: path → filename → title. Index on save/commit. Auto-update references on rename.

9. ~~**Git leader election protocol**~~ **RESOLVED**: Lease-based via relay. Daemon acquires a `git-leader` lease from relay (TTL 60s, auto-renew on heartbeat). If lease holder disconnects, lease expires, another daemon claims it. One row in relay DB per workspace. Simple, relay already manages state.

10. ~~**Reconciliation UI trigger heuristics**~~ **RESOLVED**: >50% section changed by 2+ editors within 30s. Inline resolution (Notion-style keep A/B/both).

11. **E2EE key management (V2)**: Key rotation, device authorization, recovery flows for end-to-end encrypted workspaces. Deferred but storage layer should be designed to accommodate.

12. ~~**MCP subscribe notification delivery**~~ **RESOLVED**: Polling with change token. `scriptum_status` returns `change_token` that updates when watched docs change. No push over stdio.
